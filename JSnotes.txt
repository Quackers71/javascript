Node Architect

Browsers use JS Engine

JS Code > JS Engine > Machine Code

IE - Chakra
FF - SpiderMonkey
GC - v8

Chrome - v8 (JS Engine)       Node.exe - (Embedded v8 Engine plus extra modules - built in C++) - Runtime Environment

Node is a runtime environment for executing JavaScript code
- Asynchronous Architecture
- Single Thread - to handle multiple requests
- so Asynchronous by default
- Node uses an event queue
- Ideal for I/O-intensive Apps
- Do not use Node for CPU-intensive Apps
