## Notes throughout the Book / Course

- functions / parameters & arguments from pages 89/90
- When you call a function you pass it arguments and those arguments then get matched up with the parameters in the function definition.
- You can also pass variables as arguments, and that's often the more common case.  See my_files/archive/index_copy6.js for examples.
