## Notes throughout the Book / Course

- functions / parameters & arguments from pages 89/90
- When you call a function you pass it arguments and those arguments then get matched up with the parameters in the function definition.
- You can also pass variables as arguments, and that's often the more common case. See my_files/archive/index_copy6.js for examples.<br/><br/>

- use cases (in this case they do the same thing)

  - while (answer != "forty-two");
  - for (;answer != "forty-two");

- getElementsByTagName

  - It returns an object that you can treat like an array,
    but itâ€™s actually an object called a NodeList. A NodeList is a collection of Nodes, which is just a technical name
    for the element objects that you see in the DOM tree.
